<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">My lad, that tastes of brine?"

   "Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,
    For when the knife has slit
   The throat across from ear to ear
    'Twill bleed because of it."

   Under the stars the air was light
    But dark below the boughs,
   The still air of the speechless night,
    When lovers crown their vows.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
