    That call their souls their own:
   Here by the road I loiter,
    How idle and alone.

   Ah, past the plunge of plummet,
    In seas I cannot sound,
   My heart and soul and senses,
    World without end, are drowned.

   His folly has not fellow
    Beneath the blue of day
   That gives to man or woman
    His heart and soul away.

   There flowers no balm to sain him
