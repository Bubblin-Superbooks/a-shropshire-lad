<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem I</h4><h3>1887</h3><pre class="  "><code>   From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,
    The shires have seen it plain,
   From north and south the sign returns
    And beacons burn again.

   Look left, look right, the hills are bright,
    The dales are light between,
   Because 'tis fifty years to-night
    That God has saved the Queen.

   Now, when the flame they watch not towers
    About the soil they trod,
   Lads, we'll remember friends of ours
    Who shared the work with God.
