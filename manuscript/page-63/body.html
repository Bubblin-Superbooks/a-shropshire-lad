<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Xxvi</h4><pre class="  "><code>    Along the fields as we came by
   A year ago, my love and I,
   The aspen over stile and stone
   Was talking to itself alone.
   "Oh who are these that kiss and pass?
   A country lover and his lass;
   Two lovers looking to be wed;
   And time shall put them both to bed,
   But she shall lie with earth above,
   And he beside another love."

    And sure enough beneath the tree
   There walks another love with me,
   And overhead the aspen heaves
   Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;
   And I spell nothing in their stir,
