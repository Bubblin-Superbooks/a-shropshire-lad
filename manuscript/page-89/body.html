    My friends have breathed them there;
   Warm with the blood of lads I know
    Comes east the sighing air.

   It fanned their temples, filled their lungs,
    Scattered their forelocks free;
   My friends made words of it with tongues
    That talk no more to me.

   Their voices, dying as they fly,
    Thick on the wind are sown;
   The names of men blow soundless by,
    My fellows' and my own.

   Oh lads, at home I heard you plain,
