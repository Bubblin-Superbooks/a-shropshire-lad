   The bluebells in the azured wood.

    Yonder, lightening other loads,
   The seasons range the country roads,
   But here in London streets I ken
   No such helpmates, only men;
   And these are not in plight to bear,
   If they would, another's care.
   They have enough as 'tis: I see
   In many an eye that measures me
   The mortal sickness of a mind
   Too unhappy to be kind.
   Undone with misery, all they can
   Is to hate their fellow man;
   And till they drop they needs must still
   Look at you and wish you ill.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
