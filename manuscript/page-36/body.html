   And sure enough the palms are there,
   And each will find by hedge or pond
   Her waving silver-tufted wand.

   In farm and field through all the shire
   The eye beholds the heart's desire;
   Ah, let not only mine be vain,
   For lovers should be loved again.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
