    From France to England strown;
   Black towers above the Portland light
    The felon-quarried stone.

   On yonder island, not to rise,
    Never to stir forth free,
   Far from his folk a dead lad lies
    That once was friends with me.

   Lie you easy, dream you light,
    And sleep you fast for aye;
   And luckier may you find the night
    Than ever you found the day.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
