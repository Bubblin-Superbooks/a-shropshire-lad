    They mirror true the sight I see,
   And there you find your face too clear
    And love it and be lost like me.
   One the long nights through must lie
    Spent in star-defeated sighs,
   But why should you as well as I
    Perish? gaze not in my eyes.

   A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,
    One that many loved in vain,
   Looked into a forest well
    And never looked away again.
   There, when the turf in springtime flowers,
    With downward eye and gazes sad,
   Stands amid the glancing showers
