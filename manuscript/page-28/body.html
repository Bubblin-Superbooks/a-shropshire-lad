   I heard the tune he sang me,
    And spied his yellow bill;
   I picked a stone and aimed it
    And threw it with a will:
    Then the bird was still.

   Then my soul within me
    Took up the blackbird's strain,
   And still beside the horses
    Along the dewy lane
    It Sang the song again:

   "Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
    The sun moves always west;
   The road one treads to labour
    Will lead one home to rest,
