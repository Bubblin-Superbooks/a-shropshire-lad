    That I was used to drive
   And hear the harness jingle
    When I was man alive?"

    The harness jingles now;
   No change though you lie under
    The land you used to plough.

    Along the river shore,
   With lads to chase the leather,
    Now I stand up no more?"

   Ay, the ball is flying,
