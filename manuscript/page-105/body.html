   Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,
    But men may come to worse than dust.

   Souls undone, undoing others,-
    Long time since the tale began.
   You would not live to wrong your brothers:
    Oh lad, you died as fits a man.

   Now to your grave shall friend and stranger
    With ruth and some with envy come:
   Undishonoured, clear of danger,
    Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.

   Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;
    And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:
   'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,
    But wear it and it will not fade.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
