    I ranged the thymy wold;
   The world-wide air was azure
    And all the brooks ran gold.

   There through the dews beside me
    Behold a youth that trod,
   With feathered cap on forehead,
    And poised a golden rod.

   With mien to match the morning
    And gay delightful guise
   And friendly brows and laughter
    He looked me in the eyes.
