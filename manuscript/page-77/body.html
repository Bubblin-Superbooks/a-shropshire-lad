    And yon twelve-winded sky,
   The stuff of life to knit me
    Blew hither: here am I.

   Now- for a breath I tarry
    Nor yet disperse apart-
   Take my hand quick and tell me,
    What have you in your heart.

   Speak now, and I will answer;
    How shall I help you, say;
   Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
    I take my endless way.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
