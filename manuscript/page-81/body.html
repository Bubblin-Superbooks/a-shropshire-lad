   He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,
   And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap."

   And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;
   Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;
   And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
