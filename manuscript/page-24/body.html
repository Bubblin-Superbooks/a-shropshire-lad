   Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,
    That only court to thieve,
   And once they bear the bloom away
    'Tis little enough they leave.
   Then keep your heart for men like me
    And safe from trustless chaps.
   My love is true and all for you.
    "Perhaps, young man, perhaps."

   Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?
    -Why, 'tis a mile from town.
   How green the grass is all about!
    We might as well sit down.
   -Ah, life, what is it but a flower?
    Why must true lovers sigh?
   Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,-
