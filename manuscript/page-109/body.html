   Now the best of friends must part.
   Fare you well, for ill fare I:
   Live, lads, and I will die."

   "Oh, at home had I but stayed
   'Prenticed to my father's trade,
   Had I stuck to plane and adze,
   I had not been lost, my lads."

   "Then I might have built perhaps
   Gallows-trees for other chaps,
   Never dangled on my own,
   Had I but left ill alone."
