    Up the beach of darkness brims,
   And the ship of sunrise burning
    Strands upon the eastern rims.

   Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,
    Trampled to the floor it spanned,
   And the tent of night in tatters
    Straws the sky-pavilioned land.

   Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:
    Hear the drums of morning play;
   Hark, the empty highways crying
    "Who'll beyond the hills away?"
