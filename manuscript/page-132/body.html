    And lights are guttering low:
   Square your shoulders, lift your pack,
    And leave your friends and go.

   Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,
    Look not left nor right:
   In all the endless road you tread
    There's nothing but the night.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
