    The hilly brakes around,
   For under thorn and bramble
    About the hollow ground
    The primroses are found.

   And there's the windflower chilly
    With all the winds at play,
   And there's the Lenten lily
    That has not long to stay
    And dies on Easter day.

   And since till girls go maying
    You find the primrose still,
   And find the windflower playing
</pre></div> </div>
