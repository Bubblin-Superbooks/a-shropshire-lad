    And reach your friends your hand,
   And go, and luck go with you
    While Ludlow tower shall stand.

   Oh, come you home of Sunday
    When Ludlow streets are still
   And Ludlow bells are calling
    To farm and lane and mill,

   Or come you home of Monday
    When Ludlow market hums
   And Ludlow chimes are playing
    "The conquering hero comes,"
