<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">When Severn down to Buildwas ran
   Coloured with the death of man,
   Couched upon her brother's grave
   The Saxon got me on the slave.

   The sound of fight is silent long
   That began the ancient wrong;
   Long the voice of tears is still
   That wept of old the endless ill.

   In my heart it has not died,
   The war that sleeps on Severn side;
   They cease not fighting, east and west,
   On the marches of my breast.

   Here the truceless armies yet
   Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;
   They kill and kill and never die;
