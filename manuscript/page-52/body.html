    But I know fairer far:
   Those are as beautiful again
    That in the water are;

   The pools and rivers wash so clean
    The trees and clouds and air,
   The like on earth was never seen,
    And oh that I were there.

   These are the thoughts I often think
    As I stand gazing down
   In act upon the cressy brink
    To strip and dive and drown;

   But in the golden-sanded brooks
