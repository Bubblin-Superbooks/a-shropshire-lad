<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And morn is all the same as night."

   "Rest you so from trouble sore,
   Fear the heat o' the sun no more,
   Nor the snowing winter wild,
   Now you labour not with child."

   "Empty vessel, garment cast,
   We that wore you long shall last.
   -Another night, another day."
   So my bones within me say.

   Therefore they shall do my will
   To-day while I am master still,
   And flesh and soul, now both are strong,
   Shall hale the sullen slaves along,

   Before this fire of sense decay,
</pre></div> </div>
