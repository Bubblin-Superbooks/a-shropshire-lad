   You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.
   Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here."_ 
   And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.

   "I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred
   Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;
   She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:
   I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen."
