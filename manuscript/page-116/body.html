<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">In London, the town built ill,
   'Tis sure small matter for wonder
    If sorrow is with one still.

   And if as a lad grows older
    The troubles he bears are more,
   He carries his griefs on a shoulder
    That handselled them long before.

   Where shall one halt to deliver
    This luggage I'd lief set down?
   Not Thames, not Teme is the river,
    Nor London nor Knighton the town:

   'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
    A quieter place than Clun,
   Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
    And little 'twill matter to one.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
