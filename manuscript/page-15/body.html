<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To skies that knit their heartstrings right,
    To fields that bred them brave,
   The saviours come not home to-night:
    Themselves they could not save.

   It dawns in Asia, tombstones show
    And Shropshire names are read;
   And the Nile spills his overflow
    Beside the Severn's dead.

   We pledge in peace by farm and town
    The Queen they served in war,
   And fire the beacons up and down
    The land they perished for.

   "God Save the Queen" we living sing,
    From height to height 'tis heard;
   And with the rest your voices ring,
</pre></div> </div>
