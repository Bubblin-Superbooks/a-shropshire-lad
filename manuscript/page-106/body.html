    Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:
   'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
    And many a balsam grows on ground.

   And if your hand or foot offend you,
    Cut it off, lad, and be whole;
   But play the man, stand up and end you,
    When your sickness is your soul.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
