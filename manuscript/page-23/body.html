<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem V</h4><pre class="  "><code>   Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers
    Are lying in field and lane,
   With dandelions to tell the hours
    That never are told again.
   Oh may I squire you round the meads
    And pick you posies gay?
   -'Twill do no harm to take my arm.
    "You may, young man, you may."

   Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,
    'Tis now the blood runs gold,
   And man and maid had best be glad
    Before the world is old.
   What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,
    But never as good as new.
   -Suppose I wound my arm right round-
