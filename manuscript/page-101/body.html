   And lord it in their little hour:
   The immortal bones obey control
   Of dying flesh and dying soul."

   " 'Tis long till eve and morn are gone:
   Slow the endless night comes on,
   And late to fulness grows the birth
   That shall last as long as earth."

   "Wanderers eastward, wanderers west,
   Know you why you cannot rest?
   'Tis that every mother's son
   Travails with a skeleton."

   "Lie down in the bed of dust;
   Bear the fruit that bear you must;
   Bring the eternal seed to light,
