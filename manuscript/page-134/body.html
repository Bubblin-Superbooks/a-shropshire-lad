    The slayers of themselves.

   To north, to south, lie parted,
    With Hughley tower above,
   The kind, the single-hearted,
    The lads I used to love.
   And, south or north, 'tis only
    A choice of friends one knows,
   And I shall ne'er be lonely
    Asleep with these or those.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
