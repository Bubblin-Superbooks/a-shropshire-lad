<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">"Come all to church, good people;
    Good people, come and pray."
    But here my love would stay.

   And I would turn and answer
    Among the springing thyme,
   "Oh, peal upon our wedding,
    And we will hear the chime,
    And come to church in time."

   But when the snows at Christmas
    On Bredon top were strown,
   My love rose up so early
    And stole out unbeknown
    And went to church alone.

   They tolled the one bell only,
    Groom there was none to see,
