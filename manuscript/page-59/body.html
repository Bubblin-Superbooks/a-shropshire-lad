   I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell
    The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;
   And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell
    And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.

   But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;
    And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told
   They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,
    The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
