    The golden broom should blow;
   The hawthorn sprinkled up and down
    Should charge the land with snow.

   Spring will not wait the loiterer's time
    Who keeps so long away;
   So others wear the broom and climb
    The hedgerows heaped with may.

   Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,
    Gold that I never see;
   Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge
    That will not shower on me.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
