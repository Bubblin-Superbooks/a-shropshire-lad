    Clungunford and Clun,
   Are the quietest places
    Under the sun._ 

   In valleys of springs of rivers,
    By Ony and Teme and Clun,
   The country for easy livers,
    The quietest under the sun,

   We still had sorrows to lighten,
    One could not be always glad,
   And lads knew trouble at Knighton
    When I was a Knighton lad.

   By bridges that Thames runs under,
