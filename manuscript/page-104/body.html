    Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:
   Yours was not an ill for mending,
    'Twas best to take it to the grave.

   Oh you had forethought, you could reason,
    And saw your road and where it led,
   And early wise and brave in season
    Put the pistol to your head.

   Oh soon, and better so than later
    After long disgrace and scorn,
   You shot dead the household traitor,
    The soul that should not have been born.

   Right you guessed the rising morrow
