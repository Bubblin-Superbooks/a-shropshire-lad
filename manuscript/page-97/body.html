<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And far-discovered town,

   With gay regards of promise
    And sure unslackened stride
   And smiles and nothing spoken
    Led on my merry guide.

   By blowing realms of woodland
    With sunstruck vanes afield
   And cloud-led shadows sailing
    About the windy weald,

   By valley-guarded granges
    And silver waters wide,
   Content at heart I followed
    With my delightful guide.

   And like the cloudy shadows
