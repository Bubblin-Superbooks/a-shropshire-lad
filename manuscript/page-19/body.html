<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Come you home a hero,
    Or come not home at all,
   The lads you leave will mind you
    Till Ludlow tower shall fall.

   And you will list the bugle
    That blows in lands of morn,
   And make the foes of England
    Be sorry you were born.

   And you till trump of doomsday
    On lands of morn may lie,
   And make the hearts of comrades
    Be heavy where you die.

   Leave your home behind you,
    Your friends by field and town
   Oh, town and field will mind you
