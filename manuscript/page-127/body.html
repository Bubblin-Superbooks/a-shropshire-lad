<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Lvi</h4><h3>The Day Of Battle</h3><pre class="  "><code>   "Far I hear the bugle blow
   To call me where I would not go,
   And the guns begin the song,
   'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'"

   "Comrade, if to turn and fly
   Made a soldier never die,
   Fly I would, for who would not?
   'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot."

   "But since the man that runs away
   Lives to die another day,
   And cowards' funerals, when they come
   Are not wept so well at home."
