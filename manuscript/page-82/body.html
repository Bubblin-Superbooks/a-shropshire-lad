<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Xxxv</h4><pre class="  "><code>   On the idle hill of summer,
    Sleepy with the flow of streams,
   Far I hear the steady drummer
    Drumming like a noise in dreams.

   Far and near and low and louder
    On the roads of earth go by,
   Dear to friends and food for powder,
    Soldiers marching, all to die.

   East and west on fields forgotten
    Bleach the bones of comrades slain,
   Lovely lads and dead and rotten;
    None that go return again.

   Far the calling bugles hollo,
