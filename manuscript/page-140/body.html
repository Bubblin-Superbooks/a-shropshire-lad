<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Lxiii</h4><pre class="  "><code>   I Hoed and trenched and weeded,
    And took the flowers to fair:
   I brought them home unheeded;
    The hue was not the wear.

   So up and down I sow them
    For lads like me to find,
   When I shall lie below them,
    A dead man out of mind.

   Some seed the birds devour,
    And some the season mars,
   But here and there will flower
    The solitary stars,

   And fields will yearly bear them
