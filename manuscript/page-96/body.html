    He smiled and would not say,
   And looked at me and beckoned
    And laughed and led the way.

   And with kind looks and laughter
    And nought to say beside
   We two went on together,
    I and my happy guide.

   Across the glittering pastures
    And empty upland still
   And solitude of shepherds
    High in the folded hill,

   By hanging woods and hamlets
    That gaze through orchards down
   On many a windmill turning
