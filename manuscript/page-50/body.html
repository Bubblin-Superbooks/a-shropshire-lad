   Eyes the shady night has shut
   Cannot see the record cut,
   And silence sounds no worse than cheers
   After earth has stopped the ears:

   Now you will not swell the rout
   Of lads that wore their honours out,
   Runners whom renown outran
   And the name died before the man.

   So set, before its echoes fade,
   The fleet foot on the sill of shade,
   And hold to the low lintel up
   The still-defended challenge-cup.

   And round that early-laurelled head
