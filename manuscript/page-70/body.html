   None will part us, none undo
   The knot that makes one flesh of two,
   Sick with hatred, sick with pain,
   Strangling-When shall we be slain?

   When shall I be dead and rid
   Of the wrong my father did?
   How long, how long, till spade and hearse
   Put to sleep my mother's curse?</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
