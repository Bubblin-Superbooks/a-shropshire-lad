<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:
    Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.

   Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;
    All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:
   Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation-
    Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
