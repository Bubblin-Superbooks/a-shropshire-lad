<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">You and I must keep from shame
   In London streets the Shropshire name;
   On banks of Thames they must not say
   Severn breeds worse men than they;
   And friends abroad must bear in mind
   Friends at home they leave behind.
   Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
   When I forget you, hearts of gold;
   The land where I shall mind you not
   Is the land where all's forgot.
   And if my foot returns no more
   To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
   Luck, my lads, be with you still
   By falling stream and standing hill,
   By chiming tower and whispering tree,
   Men that made a man of me.
   About your work in town and farm
   Still you'll keep my head from harm,
</pre></div> </div>
