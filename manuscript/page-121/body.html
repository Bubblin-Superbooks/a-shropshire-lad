    When lovers crown their vows,
   And whistled soft and out of sight
    In shadow of the boughs.

   "I shall not vex you with my face
    Henceforth, my love, for aye;
   So take me in your arms a space
    Before the east is grey."

   "When I from hence away am past
    I shall not find a bride,
   And you shall be the first and last
    I ever lay beside."
