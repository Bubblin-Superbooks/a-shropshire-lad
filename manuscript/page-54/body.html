   In summertime on Bredon
    The bells they sound so clear;
   Round both the shires they ring them
    In steeples far and near,
    A happy noise to hear.

   Here of a Sunday morning
    My love and I would lie
   And see the coloured counties,
    And hear the larks so high
    About us in the sky.

   The bells would ring to call her
    In valleys miles away:
