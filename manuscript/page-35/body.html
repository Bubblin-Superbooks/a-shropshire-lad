<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem X</h4><h3>March</h3><pre class="  "><code>   The sun at noon to higher air,
   Unharnessing the silver Pair
   That late before his chariot swam,
   Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.

   So braver notes the storm-cock sings
   To start the rusted wheel of things,
   And brutes in field and brutes in pen
   Leap that the world goes round again.

   The boys are up the woods with day
   To fetch the daffodils away,
   And home at noonday from the hills
   They bring no dearth of daffodils.
