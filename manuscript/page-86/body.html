   The train ran, changing sky and shire,
   And far behind, a fading crest,
   Low in the forsaken west
   Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
   My hand lay empty on my knee.
   Aching on my knee it lay:
   That morning half a shire away
   So many an honest fellow's fist
   Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
   Hand, said I, since now we part
   From fields and men we know by heart,
   From strangers' faces, strangers' lands,-
   Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
   Be clean then; rot before you do
   A thing they'd not believe of you.
