   Say, for what were hop-yards meant,
   Or why was Burton built on Trent?
   Oh many a peer of England brews
   Livelier liquor than the Muse,
   And malt does more than Milton can
   To justify God's ways to man.
   Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink
   For fellows whom it hurts to think:
   Look into the pewter pot
   To see the world as the world's not.
   And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:
   The mischief is that 'twill not last.
   Oh I have been to Ludlow fair
   And left my necktie God knows where,
   And carried half-way home, or near,
   Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:
   Then the world seemed none so bad,
