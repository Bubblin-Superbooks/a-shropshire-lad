<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Xlvi</h4><pre class="  "><code>    Bring, in this timeless grave to throw,
   No cypress, sombre on the snow;
   Snap not from the bitter yew
   His leaves that live December through;
   Break no rosemary, bright with rime
   And sparkling to the cruel clime;
   Nor plod the winter land to look
   For willows in the icy brook
   To cast them leafless round him: bring
   No spray that ever buds in spring.

    But if the Christmas field has kept
   Awns the last gleaner overstept,
   Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue
   A single season, never two;
   Or if one haulm whose year is o'er
