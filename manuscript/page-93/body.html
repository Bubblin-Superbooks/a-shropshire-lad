   Homely comforters I had:
   The earth, because my heart was sore,
   Sorrowed for the son she bore;
   And standing hills, long to remain,
   Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.
   And bound for the same bourn as I,
   On every road I wandered by,
   Trod beside me, close and dear,
   The beautiful and death-struck year:
   Whether in the woodland brown
   I heard the beechnut rustle down,
   And saw the purple crocus pale
   Flower about the autumn dale;
   Or littering far the fields of May
   Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,
