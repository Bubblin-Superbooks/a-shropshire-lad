   We chaired you through the market-place;
   Man and boy stood cheering by,
   And home we brought you shoulder-high.

   To-day, the road all runners come,
   Shoulder-high we bring you home,
   And set you at your threshold down,
   Townsman of a stiller town.

   Smart lad, to slip betimes away
   From fields where glory does not stay
   And early though the laurel grows
