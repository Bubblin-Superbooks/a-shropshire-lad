   Years, ere you stood up from rest,
   On my neck the collar prest;
   Years, when you lay down your ill,
   I shall stand and bear it still.
   Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:
   Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."
   So I thought his look would say;
   And light on me my trouble lay,
   And I slept out in flesh and bone
   Manful like the man of stone.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
