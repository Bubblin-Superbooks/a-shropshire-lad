<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Ix</h4><pre class="  "><code>   On moonlit heath and lonesome bank
    The sheep beside me graze;
   And yon the gallows used to clank
    Fast by the four cross ways.

   A careless shepherd once would keep
    The flocks by moonlight there, (1)
   And high amongst the glimmering sheep
    The dead man stood on air.

   They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:
    The whistles blow forlorn,
   And trains all night groan on the rail
    To men that die at morn.

   There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,
