<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Towns and countries woo together,
    Forelands beacon, belfries call;
   Never lad that trod on leather
    Lived to feast his heart with all.

   Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber
    Sunlit pallets never thrive;
   Morns abed and daylight slumber
    Were not meant for man alive.

   Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;
    Breath's a ware that will not keep
   Up, lad: when the journey's over
    There'll be time enough to sleep.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
