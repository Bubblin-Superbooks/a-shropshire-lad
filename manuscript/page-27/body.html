    And mist blew off from Teme,
   And blithe afield to ploughing
    Against the morning beam
    I strode beside my team,

   The blackbird in the coppice
    Looked out to see me stride,
   And hearkened as I whistled
    The tramping team beside,
    And fluted and replied:

   "Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
    What use to rise and rise?
   Rise man a thousand mornings
    Yet down at last he lies,
