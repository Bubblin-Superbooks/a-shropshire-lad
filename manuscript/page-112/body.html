<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Poem Xlviii</h4><pre class="  "><code>   Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,
    Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.
   Think rather,-call to thought, if now you grieve a little,
    The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.

   Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry
    I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;
   Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:
    Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.

   Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,
    I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.
